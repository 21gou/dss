The dss-package version 3.0-SNAPSHOT-20130718 is a work in progress.
It is meant to early get feedback by the technical adviser of the DG MARKT - foremost on the design aspects.

This version aims the second phase of implementing a new Validation Policy and Report Simplification specification.
The addressed topics are:
- Alignment with the new standard of the LTV validation process.

It currently does not cover:
- Design and creation of the new administration module for validation policy
- Design and creation of the simplified/aggregated version of the validation report based on the new indication/sub-indication structure.

A further limitation is:
- The validation of specifically PAdES LTV signatures is not implemented.
- The webapplication - moreover the applet - is likely to not work properly.

It is recommended to use the library via plain Java code.
