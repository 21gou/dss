The dss-package version 3.0-SNAPSHOT-20130524 is a work in progress.
It is meant to demonstrate the achievements related to the goal described below.
As such, it is not production-ready and may even not reliable in end-to-end scenarios or specific use cases.
Specifically, you should run this only from within the IDE as it accesses resources via File mechanisms.

This version aims the first phase of implementing a new Validation Policy and Report Simplification specification.
The addressed topics are:
- Integration of the new standardâ€™s basic building blocks:
  - (ISC) Identification of the signer's certificate
  - (VCI) Validation Context Initialization
  - (XCV) X.509 Certificate Validation
  - (CV) Cryptographic Verification
  - (SAV) Signature Acceptance Validation
- Integration of (BVP) Basic Validation Process
- Integration of (VPTS) Validation Process for Time-Stamps
- Integration of (VPAT) Validation Process for AdES-T

The responsible code is located in the modules dss-service, dss-service and dss-spi under the package eu.europa.ec.markt.dss:
- validation
  This retains the old development, but is actually dead code in terms of execution usage.
  As such it can be considered that the package and/or its content will be completely removed in a future version.
- validation102853
  This contains the new (non-finalised) code.
  The name of the package (referring to ETSI TS 120 853) will probably change in the next stable release.

Note that its processing is mainly XML-based (diagnostic data) and makes use of scripting regarding the rules.
A specific proprietary script engine is used that is provided as jar.
See the main pom for explanations on how to install this Maven dependency for compiling the sources.

Additional major changes - amongst others - are:
- DocumentSignatureService: API revamped
- SignatureParameters: new attributes, deprecation of some setters/getters, slight reorganisation
