The dss-package version 4.1.0.

This version includes :
- Validation with warnings:
- To give more flexibility to the process of validating a signature a new constraint level "WARN" was introduced. Now every constraint within the validation policy may not be blocking but considered as a simple warning.
- Make ASiC-S signature handling multiple signatures:
- This type of signature can contain a timestamp as a separate signature which must also be validated.
- Make ASiC-S containers compatible with CAdES signature:
- This type of container can contain a XAdES or CAdES kind of signature. The inclusion of this last one has been added.
- Java 1.7 compatibility
- Parallelise the information search to improve performance:
- To accelerate the process of the signature validation, the issuer certificate and the revocation data are retrieved in parallel manner.
- Manage the scope of signatures:
- The validation report must include the indication of the scope of signature (if the whole document(s) is covered by signature)
- Support plain signature:
- The validation process must support the validation of non AdES signature.
- Fix the validation of the signatures with the archive timestamp using the link to the TSL:
- When validating a signature the validity of the associated service must be taken into account.
